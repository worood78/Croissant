    <h1>Welcome to croissant World</h1>
    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, viennoiserie pastry of Austrian origin,
      but mostly associated with France. Croissants are made of alayered
      yeast-leavened dough. The dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
      several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique
      called laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture,
      similar to a puff pastry. Croissants have long been a staple of Austrian,
      Italian, and French bakeries and pâtisseries. The modern croissant was
      developed in the early 20th century. In the late 1970s, the development of
      factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made them into a fast
      food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor. The croissant bakery,
      notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French response to
      American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the croissants sold in
      French bakeries and patisseries were baked from frozen dough. Croissants
      are a common part of a continental breakfast in many European countries.
